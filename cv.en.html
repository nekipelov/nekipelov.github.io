<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildberries">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildberries</a>
<br>Team leader, rust team<br>
April 2020 - now</p>

<p>Created a new team rust and front-end developers. We maked together:</p>

<p>Video surveillance system for more then 10k of cameras.
It consumes video stream from cameras, writes a video archive
(several months, as long as there is enough space on servers allocated for storage),
providing convenient and fast navigation through the archive: selection of any moment
in time, screenshots on the timeline, fast playback, export part of video for
incident investigation. Viewing live broadcasts from cameras via webrtc.
Authentication and access control to cameras and directories.</p>


<p>We are currently working on an object storage with S3 protocol project.
Key requirements from management:

<ul>
    <li>Can be stored 2 billion objects</li>
    <li>Ease of operation.</li>
    <li>Scalability. The amount of data is growing at a rapid pace all the time.</li>
    <li>Complete data consistency, we agreed to use the raft algorithm.</li>
    <li>Fault tolerance with multiple data center. Every minute of downtime
        will result in a loss of money.</li>
    <li>At the moment, the repository is at the stage of test implementation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Technologies used: rust (almost all components are written in this language),
C++ (not much, only part of the video surveillance system that works
directly with video, rtsp and webrtc), clickhouse, postgresql, rtsp, webrtc.
<br /> Platform: Linux
